Below are the points on which you need to work on the basis of experience gained from "Alien Hunt":

*Design*
1. Images have better performance then graphics drawn with the Canvas API.
2. Learn a design tool (gimp,inkscape,photoshop,illustrator)
3. Practice designing a game prototype daily - keep practicing forever :)
4. Keep in mind graphics scaling (up and down)

*Programming*
1. Learn ray based collision for bullet objects.
2. Improve time based motion-physics.
3. Write optimized code for better performance.
4. Learn how to scale game on various screen sizes.
5. Make games mobile phone compatible.
6. Enable sound on IE11 and lower version browsers.

*Game Engine*
1. Use node.js in the engine
2. Seperate rendering,physics and sound.
3. Refer phaser and pixi.js for code style and implementation reference as they are open source.

*Business and Developmennt*
1. Use facebook features to get approval on App Store
2. Create promotion content and presskit()
3. Create animation, art everyday - publish on youtube if possible.


Major Actions To Be Accomplished:
1. Game A Day - prepare a game prototype daily. Learn the art of prototyping. Follow below steps:
	- Game concept
	- Code
	- Art 
	- Sound
	- Menu
 Time limit max two hours i.e., by 10.30 AM

2. Learn game design/art - expertise on the tool (gimp.inkscape), draw some stuff on daily basis.
